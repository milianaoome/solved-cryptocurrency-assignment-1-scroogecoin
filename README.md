In ScroogeCoin (Lecture 1), the central authority Scrooge receives transactions from users. You will implement the logic used by Scrooge to process transactions and produce the ledger. Scrooge organizes transactions into time periods or blocks. In each block, Scrooge will receive a list of transactions, validate the transactions he receives, and publish a list of validated transactions.




Note that a transaction can reference another in the same block. Also, among the transactions received by Scrooge in a single block, more than one transaction may spend the same output. This would of course be a double-spend, and hence invalid. This means that transactions can’t be validated in isolation; it is a tricky problem to choose a subset of transactions that are ​    ​<em>together</em> valid.




You will be provided with a ​Transaction​ class that represents a ScroogeCoin transaction and has inner classes ​Transaction.Output​ and ​Transaction.Input​.




A transaction output consists of a value and a public key to which it is being paid. For the public keys, we use the built-in Java <u>​</u><u>PublicKey</u><u>​</u> class.




A transaction input consists of the hash of the transaction that contains the corresponding output, the index of this output in that transaction (indices are simply integers starting from 0), and a digital signature. For the input to be valid, the signature it contains must be a valid signature over the current transaction with the public key in the spent output.




More specifically, the raw data that is signed is obtained from the ​getRawDataToSign(int index)​ method. To verify a signature, you will use the ​verifySignature()​ method included in the provided file Crypto.java:

<strong> </strong>

public static boolean verifySignature(PublicKey pubKey, byte[] message, byte[] signature)







This method takes a public key, a message and a signature, and returns true if and only ​signature correctly verifies over ​message​ with the public key ​pubKey​<strong>. </strong>




Note that you are only given code to verify signatures, and this is all that you will need for this assignment. The computation of signatures is done outside the Transaction class by an entity that knows the appropriate private keys.







A transaction consists of a list of inputs, a list of outputs and a unique ID (see the ​getRawTx() method). The class also contains methods to add and remove an input, add an output, compute digests to sign/hash, add a signature to an input, and compute and store the hash of the transaction once all inputs/outputs/signatures have been added.




You will also be provided with a ​UTXO​ class that represents an unspent transaction output. A ​UTXO contains the hash of the transaction from which it originates as well as its index within that transaction. We have included ​equals​, ​hashCode​, and ​compareTo​ functions in ​UTXO​ that allow the testing of equality and comparison between two ​UTXO​s based on their indices and the contents of their txHash arrays.




Further, you will be provided with a ​UTXOPool​ class that represents the current set of outstanding UTXO​s and contains a map from each ​UTXO​ to its corresponding transaction output. This class contains constructors to create a new empty ​UTXOPool​ or a copy of a given ​UTXOPool​, and methods to add and remove ​UTXO​s from the pool, get the output corresponding to a given ​UTXO​, check if a UTXO​ is in the pool, and get a list of all ​UTXO​s in the pool.




You will be responsible for creating a file called ​TxHandler.java​ that implements the following API:




<table width="624">

 <tbody>

  <tr>

   <td width="624"><strong>public</strong>​ ​<strong>class</strong>​ ​<strong>TxHandler</strong>​ { ​/** Creates a public ledger whose current UTXOPool (collection of unspent      * transaction outputs) is utxoPool. This should make a defensive copy of*         utxoPool by using the UTXOPool(UTXOPool uPool) constructor.*/​<strong>public</strong>​ ​<strong>TxHandler</strong>​(UTXOPool utxoPool); ​/** Returns true if*         (1) all outputs claimed by tx are in the current UTXO pool,*         (2) the signatures on each input of tx are valid,*         (3) no UTXO is claimed multiple times by tx,*         (4) all of tx’s output values are non-negative, and*         (5) the sum of tx’s input values is greater than or equal to the sum of             its output values;​ ​and false otherwise.*/​<strong>public</strong>​ ​<strong>boolean</strong>​ ​<strong>isValidTx</strong>​(Transaction tx); ​/** Handles each epoch by receiving an unordered array of proposed*         transactions, checking each transaction for correctness,*         returning a mutually valid array of accepted transactions,      * and updating the current UTXO pool as appropriate.*/​<strong>public</strong>​ Transaction[] ​<strong>handleTxs</strong>​(Transaction[] possibleTxs); }</td>

  </tr>

 </tbody>

</table>













Your implementation of ​handleTxs()​ should return a mutually valid transaction set of maximal size (one that can’t be enlarged simply by adding more transactions). It need not compute a set of maximum size (one for which there is no larger mutually valid transaction set).




Based on the transactions it has chosen to accept, ​handleTxs​ should also update its internal UTXOPool​ to reflect the current set of unspent transaction outputs, so that future calls to handleTxs()​ and ​isValidTx()​ are able to correctly process/validate transactions that claim outputs from transactions that were accepted in a previous call to ​handleTxs()​.




<strong>Extra Credit:</strong>​ Create a second file called ​MaxFeeTxHandler.java​ whose ​handleTxs()​ ​method finds a set of transactions with maximum total transaction fees — i.e. maximize the sum over all transactions in the set of (sum of input values – sum of output values)).
